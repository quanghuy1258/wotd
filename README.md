# wotd
Word of the day (Oxford) + Message of the day (Ubuntu)

---
To use "message of the day" (motd) function, just append
```
  $ python main.py
```
or something similar at the end of ".bashrc", ".zshrc", etc. file.

Note: I know motd is not like I describe above, but it works like a true one and I don't need to modify any system configurations.
